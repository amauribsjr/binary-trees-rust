# Binary Trees in Rust

BST · AVL · Red-Black Tree

---

## Overview

This project presents three classical binary tree data structures implemented in Rust:

* Binary Search Tree (BST)
* AVL Tree
* Red-Black Tree (RBT)

The objective is to provide a clear and faithful implementation of each structure, preserving the original algorithms while adapting them to Rust’s ownership and safety model.

The code prioritizes:

* clarity over abstraction
* explicit algorithmic steps
* safe memory management (no unsafe usage at any condition)
* close correspondence with traditional textbook implementations

## Project Structure
```
src/
└── bin/
    ├── bst/
    │   ├── main.rs
    │   └── bst.rs
    ├── avl/
    │   ├── main.rs
    │   └── avl.rs
    └── rbt/
        ├── main.rs
        └── rbt.rs
```
Each tree is implemented as a separate binary target.

* main.rs handles the command-line interface
* the corresponding .rs file contains the full data structure logic

## Implemented Structures

### 1. Binary Search Tree (BST)

A standard binary search tree without any balancing mechanism.

Properties:

* Left subtree contains values smaller than the node
* Right subtree contains values greater than the node
* Duplicate values are not inserted

Operations:

* Iterative insertion
* Search
* Removal using in-order successor
* Height calculation
* In-order traversal
* Level-order visualization

Complexity:

Search: average O(log n), worst O(n)
Insert: average O(log n), worst O(n)
Remove: average O(log n), worst O(n)

---

### 2. AVL Tree

A self-balancing binary search tree.

Key idea:
Each node stores its height and maintains a balance factor defined as:

balance = height(left) - height(right)

Allowed values are -1, 0, or 1. Any violation triggers rebalancing through rotations.

Rotations:

* Left rotation
* Right rotation
* Left-Right rotation
* Right-Left rotation

Operations:

* Recursive insertion with rebalancing
* Recursive removal with rebalancing
* Height tracking at each node
* Search
* Traversal and visualization

Complexity:

Search: O(log n)
Insert: O(log n)
Remove: O(log n)

---

### 3. Red-Black Tree (RBT)

A balanced binary search tree based on node coloring.

Properties:

1. Each node is either red or black
2. The root is always black
3. Red nodes cannot have red children
4. Every path from a node to its descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes

Implementation approach:

Instead of pointer-based references, this implementation uses a vector of nodes and index-based links.

Each node stores:

* parent index
* left child index
* right child index

A missing child is represented as None, which behaves like a black NIL node.

This approach avoids:

* unsafe code
* borrowing conflicts
* complex lifetime management

Operations:

* Insertion with fix-up (recoloring and rotations)
* Removal with fix-up (case-based balancing)
* Search
* Height calculation
* Traversals

Complexity:

Search: O(log n)
Insert: O(log n)
Remove: O(log n)

---

## Design Decisions

1. No unsafe code
   All implementations rely strictly on safe Rust constructs.

2. Explicit ownership model

* BST and AVL use Box<Node>
* RBT uses Vec<Node> with indices

3. Conservative implementation style
   The code follows traditional algorithmic structure instead of relying on idiomatic shortcuts. This makes it easier to compare with implementations in languages such as C or Java.

4. Separation of concerns

* Data structure logic is isolated in bst.rs, avl.rs, and rbt.rs
* User interaction is handled exclusively in main.rs

---

## How to Run

From the project root directory:

cargo run --bin bst
cargo run --bin avl
cargo run --bin rbt

---

## CLI Features

Each executable provides:

* Insert value
* Search value
* Remove value
* Calculate tree height
* Print tree in-order
* Print tree by level

---

## Output Representation

In-order traversal:
Displays sorted values.

Example:
1 3 5 7 9

Level view:
Displays the tree structure using spacing and placeholders (n or ---).

Red-Black Tree:
Nodes include color information.

Example:
10B 15R 20B

## Educational Notes

This project is intended as a study reference.

Key aspects to observe:

* how recursion interacts with ownership
* how rotations restructure the tree
* how AVL and RBT maintain balance differently
* how Rust enforces memory safety in pointer-like structures

---

## Possible Extensions

* Generic support (T implementing Ord)
* Tree iterators (in-order, pre-order, post-order)
* Persistent (immutable) tree variants
* Performance benchmarks comparing BST, AVL, and RBT
* Graph visualization (Graphviz)
* Unit and property-based tests
